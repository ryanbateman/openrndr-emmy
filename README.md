# openrndr-boids
An implementation of the [Boids algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) using OpenRNDR, a Kotlin-based creative coding framework. This implementation also then includes 'predators' in the form of locally sourced airplane data, which are rendered then as predators the boids must avoid.
